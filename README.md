## 📚 Description

Use this as a starting point to complete the WDD 330 team activity: the SleepOutside web application. It scaffolds out a simple web app with Vite support to bundle up our assets.

## 🌴 Prerequisites

- You must have Node installed. visit https://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/lesson01/l01-software.html and skip to the Node section for instructions

## 🛠️ Setup

- `npm install`
- `npm run start` starts up a local server and updates on any JS or CSS/SCSS changes.

## 🔩 Other commands

- `npm run build` to build final files when you are ready to turn in.
- `npm run lint` to run ESLint against your code to find errors.
- `npm run format` to run Prettier to automatically format your code.

## 🎯 Group board
The team uses [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/cFO3OShi/wdd330-team-18) to manage the team project. This will be the team's shared board to work on throughout the block. 

Each team member:
- read the details of the card.
- add and edit tasks on the board. 
- responsible with their cards by moving them to appropriate columns ("Doing", "Done"). 

## 📈 Review process
Team members should follow this process with each of the Trello tasks they complete.
1. Choose a Trello card, assign yourself to it, and move to "Doing".
2. Pull any changes from your team's project.
3. Make a branch.
4. Complete the work.
5. Lint and format the code.
6. Commit and push.
7. Make a pull request for your new branch.
8. Let your group know there is a pull request waiting.
9. Another team member should review the pull request in GitHub and, if everything looks good, Merge the request.
10. Delete the old branch.
11. Move the Trello card to the "Done" list.
